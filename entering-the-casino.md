Striding though the corridor under the ceiling painted to look like a daytime sky, he knew that this would be a good trip. He’d played in this casino many times; he knew the lay of the land. He wasn’t surprised there was a line at the front desk, even at this time of day. He found his way to the back, and took in his surroundings while he waited for his room assignment. That’s how he thought of it, _room assignment_. He’d been travelling for months, now – using his charming nature to win himself free room and board at over twenty different casinos. At first, it had been exciting. Using his skill with numbers, and his long practice at maintaining a cheerful face, to win money and respect -and comps. The comps were the thing, the icing that made this cake, best. There was just something about sitting down to a meal that was extravagant in nature, and cooked to perfection before retiring to your lavish bedroom suite - and knowing that you didn’t have to pay a thing! - that felt rich. It felt richer than holding the billfold he kept his gambling money in. That money could be gone in a night, if his luck wasn’t with him. But the night of rest, the full belly and taste on his lips – that was his, just because of the respect he’d earned. Or, at least that’s the way he saw it, in those days.

Lately though, he had started to feel adrift. And perhaps a bit cynical. When he used up his free stay at any particular casino hotel, he’d leave the whole state behind. He didn’t want to hang around anywhere, too long. He’d rather never walk into a coffee shop, and have his order waiting for him. But the grandeur he used to feel as each hotel strived to overwhelm him with opulence, had dulled. He no longer stood just inside the doorway to his suite, taking it all in. Looking over the gilded end tables and stand lamps, marveling at the masterful combining of gaudiness and elegance, were a thing of the past. Now, he entered his rooms with no more than a casual read of the layout. He cared more for the view from his windows. He preferred to look out over the city he was in, rather than the perfectly manicured courtyards of the hotel. Looking out at the city reminded him of where he was, brought a sense of stability to his life. He might not have the same view, tomorrow, but this view would still exist.

The line lurched along as a family of five gathered themselves and their belongings and trudged off toward the elevators. They seemed to have come a long way to celebrate the youngest boy’s ascension to adulthood, and to have used up their energy for today. They chose a fine place for it, he thought. The marble columns and false sky certainly lend themselves to the feeling of gaining stature.
